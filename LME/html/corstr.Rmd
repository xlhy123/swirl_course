In analysis of clustered data, correlation between subjects/observations within a level is always taken into account. LME models basically allow the assumption of correlation matrix. You could read extra materials for more information. The following linked paper is a good one. http://www.jneurosci.org/content/30/32/10601.full

In R, you could specify the correlation structure in function **nlme::lme**. 

#### Usage
lme(fixed, data, random, correlation, weights, subset, method,
    na.action, control, contrasts = NULL, keep.data = TRUE)

The function supports a lot of correlation sturctures. You can see R help for more details.
